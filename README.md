# Unhandled Exception in calculate Function
This repository contains a JavaScript program that demonstrates an unhandled exception in a `calculate` function. The program defines functions for basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide). The `calculate` function takes two numbers and an operation as input and performs the corresponding operation.  However, it currently throws a generic error message for invalid operations and a division by zero error. The solution improves error handling to provide more informative error messages.
